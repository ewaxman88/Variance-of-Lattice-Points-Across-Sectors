# Variance-of-Lattice-Points-Across-Sectors
This code demonstrates how to compute the variance of lattice points across thin sectors

## Project Overview

This repository contains Wolfram Language code and a Mathematica Notebook demonstrating the computation of the variance of lattice points within thin angular sectors in a 2D plane.

## Contents

This repository includes the following files:

* `Variance of Lattice Points.nb`: The original Wolfram Mathematica Notebook, containing the full interactive code.
* `VariancePointsCode.wls`: A plain Wolfram Language source file extracted from the notebook, containing only the executable code. This allows for easy viewing of the raw code on GitHub and is readily runnable in any Mathematica environment.
* `images/variance_graph_plot.png`: A visual representation of the key findings, showcasing the computed variance of lattice points across sectors for a circle of radius R = 10,000.
* `LICENSE`: This project is open-sourced under the terms of the **MIT License**.
* `README.md`: This file, providing an overview and instructions for the repository.

## Visual Showcase

Below is a plot illustrating the calculated variance of lattice points across sectors generated by the code:
